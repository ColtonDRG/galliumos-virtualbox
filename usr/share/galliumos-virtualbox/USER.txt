  This machine automatically logs into the default user. That said, you will
probably want root access or to know the password for some other reason. The
default login is listed below.

    Username: galliumos
    Password: galliumos

  You can change the password at any time by simply running `passwd` and
following the prompts.

  An OpenSSH daemon is also included. You can remotely log into this machine's
command line (if it's running) by entering the following command on any other
Linux or Unix-like system on the network with OpenSSH installed. This may vary
slightly or not work at all depending on your network configuration.

    ssh galliumos@galliumos-vm

  The root account is locked by default. You are expected to run administrative
commands via sudo as you would on any Ubuntu or GalliumOS system. If you wish
to unlock the root account for some reason, simply run the following command.

    sudo passwd -u root

  After unlocking the root account, the login is very simple.

    Username: root
    Password: galliumos

  You can change the password for the root account at any time by simply
running `passwd` as root and following the prompts.

  Anything else regarding users and groups should be self-explanitory if you
know your way around a Linux box.
